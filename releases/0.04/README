ipt_ACCT is an accounting module for iptables.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

First you must load module ipt_ACCT into your kernel. This could be done
by appropriate insmod(8) or modprobe(8) execution. Description of module
parameters can be obtained via modinfo(8).

Usage: iptables ... -j ACCT [--magic N] [--header[=N]] [--critical]
                            [--continue|--accept|--drop]

Any matched packet will be accounted by src:sport. dst:dport, proto,
and magic values.

Options:
  --header[=N]
    Add additional N (or link level header size if N is omitted)
    bytes to size of IP packet (defaults to 0).
  --critical
    Accept packet even if it cannot be accounted due to accounting
    tables overrun.
  --continue
    Return packet to firewall after accounting (default).
  --accept
    Accept packet after accounting.
  --drop
    Drop packet after accounting.

Dumps and statistics could be viewed with help of dump_ipt_acct and
stat_ipt_acct programs. Anyone is free to write his own userland utilities
using ioctl's from ipt_ACCT.h.
